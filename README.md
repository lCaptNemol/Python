Just a simple Python Script that combines Multiple Word Documents Together using the Docxcompose library
It Combines word docs with complex formatting seamlessly. 

Working on adding page breaks and a counter in the output text to show how many word docs were combined; limitation is that corrupted files are not combined into the master spreadsheet 
and so a count would help atleast show how many docs were combined. 

I am learning Python and this seemed like a good useful project to get me started on my Journey

Also, with this file, I am learning how to track changes with Git and learning how to upload to GitHub
